Venezuela's presidential elections in July 2024 are neither free nor fair. The democratic opposition will nevertheless run against the authoritarian regime of [[Nicolás Maduro]], who will use and misuse the levers of power in any way he can to stay in power.

The logic of these elections, then, is based on the political strategy of the authoritarian ruler: *divide et impera*, **divide and rule**. We'll now look at some of the dirty tricks authoritarians like Maduro use to try to steal elections. The guiding principle is the following:

> The authoritarian corrupts the election process to make it nearly impossible for the real opposition to run, while he encourages corrupt and wild candidates to run independently. The aim is to fragment the opposition vote.

Let's look at the ballot:

*Note that rows are the first digit, the second digit the column.*

## 1: Thirteen places for Maduro

The first row is full of parties - big and small - that support [[Nicolás Maduro]] as a candidate.

## 2. Not even one for the real opposition candidate

E25: The **coalition of democratic opposition parties is the MUD** (Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, now also called the "platform"). In primaries they selected [[María Corina Machado]] as their candidate, who received over 90% of the vote. However, the regime banned her from holding public office for 15 years during the primary election campaign and now barred her from registering for the presidential election, too. 

Machado picked a replacement candidate (Corina Yoris), who was also unable to register. After several attempts, the MUD was able to put a little known politician on the ballot: the diplomat [[Edmundo González]]. He is now the opposition's official unity candidate, representing the opposition.

Look at the entire ballot and that one square on E25: that's the real opposition, which, according to current polls, would easily defeat the government in a free and fair contest. Maduro is obliterated by all three of the real opposition candidates: If Machado were in the race, she'd flatten Maduro ~70% to ~9%, and her barred substitute Yoris ~38% to ~10% ([April, Megaanálisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tSReQeVZHrfA8aaYCP77026nz2x2WoDi/view?pli=1)).

Even the previously unknown González already leads Maduro with ~32% to ~11%. ([April Flash, Megaanálisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6swKgLGjgx8xjeLe0YumwWzYynZ6hR3/view))

Although the "don't knows" (no sabe) are still considerable, it's clear that if you're Maduro you can't allow free and fair elections under any circumstances. So what do you do? Let's go see and look at the ballot.

## 3: Opposition parties taken over by the regime

One option: The main opposition parties have been "intervened". This means that the Venezuelan Supreme Court (controlled by the dictatorship) arbitrarily removed the **leaders** of the parties and replaced them with pro-Maduro leaders who now pretend to represent these parties.
- The main opposition parties are Vente Venezuela, Primero Justicia, Voluntad Popular, Acción Democrática, and COPEI. The actual leaders of these parties all support the MUD and the unity candidate. 
- Vente Venezuela by [[María Corina Machado]] has been **denied registration as a political party** since 2015, so you won't even find her party on the ballot.
- Some of the other parties are present on the ballot (marked "3"), but **to promote false candidates brought forth by the imposed leadership**. They are:
	- Luis Eduardo Martínez for "Acción Democrática"
	- Daniel Ceballos for "Voluntad Popular"
	- José Brito for "Primero Venezuela" (copycat of the real party called Primero Justicia)
	- Juan Carlos Alvarado for "COPEI" (candidature withdrawn for Luis Eduardo Martínez)
- The communist party PCV was also "intervened" in. They wanted to register their own candidate and not support Maduro.

## 4: Wild candidates are given easy access

Another option: While the authoritarian regime made it almost impossible for the MUD to register, a plethora of smaller wild candidates were given easy access. 

It's perhaps unsurprising that these third way candidates talk the third way talk of reconciliation, ending the polarization, overcoming the conflict, etc - all the while a dictatorship is being built. One is reminded of those Europeans cozing up to Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine. It's an expression of the understandable but fundamentally juvenile wish to evade an inescapable confrontation with a bully. (There's also corruption, which I might investigate more in the future.)

I'll try and order these candidates by how likely they are to withdraw and support the MUD.
- Un Nuevo Tiempo (G37) have registered their president **Manuel Rosales**, who was supported by MPV (G27) and Fuerza Vecinal (G47). He has since withdrawn and is in favour of electing the MUD unity candidate González.
- Enrique Márquez for Centrados (E35) is a genuine opposition figure and wants to "overcome" the conflict. He did not support the MUD's election boycott in 2018, which proved to be a mistake, and was kicked out of Nuevo Tiempo for it. Now he thinks Machado's disqualification was unfair - but now the field is open again. [Nevertheless, he says](https://www.youtube.com/live/u6mOGcM0AfA?si=5XcyVOUsTsqNSF9R&t=1902) who would withdraw if there was another candidate with a better chance of defeating Maduro. Let's see if he honours the pledge.
- Javier Bertucci for El Cambio (D44) is a popular evangelist pastor and, oddly, supported by the government.
- Claudio Fermín for Soluciones (H48) also wants to ["end the polarisation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xniJAi4swMY). He has been in politics for a long time. 
- Antonio Ecarri from Lápiz (J30) portrays himself as the great conciliator and seeks equidistance from the government ("the worst government in the history of Venezuela") and the opposition ("just as much a disaster"). The opposition calls him corrupt and makes a big deal out of the fact that Maduro invited him to the Miraflores presidential palace. Note also the "Min Unidad" party, which looks very similar to the opposition's logo.
- Benjamín Rausseo is standing with Conde (D34). He is a comedian and initially took part in the MUD primaries, but then withdrew. He too wants to construct a campaign without ["hate" or vengeance](https://youtu.be/EUar8RCobzk?si=Y-zwicWyIxI3epJ6&t=1251).
- Luis Rati entered the race for DD (D24). He has withdrawn his candidacy and is supporting the false "Acción Democrática" candidate, Luis Eduardo Martínez.
