title: Summary of "A practical theory of power in international politics"
---
The aim here is to provide the briefest possible summary of my longer [[metatheory|"A practical theory of power in international politics"]]. 

We operate with a very wide **definition of politics** as the activity through which people make the general rules under which they live[^heywood], and not any of its narrower (and more dogmatic) alternatives ([[metatheory#What is politics?|see here for more]]).

As for **power**, we begin with the most common analytical definition: A has power over B, if A can make B do what A wants.[^dahl] Hans J. Morgenthau elaborated: "Power may comprise anything that establishes and maintains the power of man over man. Thus power covers all social relationships which serve that end, from physical violence to the most subtle psychological ties by which one mind controls another."[^morgenthau]


## Power looking backward and forward in time

An interesting property of this definition is that it can only define what power is after power has been successfully used. The definition does not actually define any concrete thing power is, but announces what it will have been when you look back in time - namely, that thing which will have convinced B to submit to A's will. The means that will achieve this control isn’t predefined – if anything, it’s post-defined. My martial arts skills do not give me in and of themselves power over you, only once I successfully used them to threaten you into giving me your ice cream can we confidently call them my "means of power".

We’ll see that repeated and institutionalised interaction diminishes this problem. But here we’ll stick with simple power. In this realm, to know beforehand whether or not you’ll submit to the threat of my martial arts skills is somewhere between an art and a science. The reason is that it is _you_ who chooses to submit or not. In the moment right after I issued my threat, it’s _your_ cost-benefit calculation that counts, not mine. So it may be that you’re a judo master and confident that you could beat me easily. Even then, maybe to you the hassle just isn’t worth an ice cream. It requires some knowledge of the other party to know which threats they may yield to.

And if you choose not to submit and violence breaks out? Well, as Morgenthau (and many, many others) knew: "When violence becomes an actuality, it signifies the abdication of political power in favour of military or pseudo-military power."[^morgenthau] If you consider that A essentially tries to control B's behaviour, you immediately see that if A has to resort to brute physical force to do so (what Morgenthau called ‘military power’) that must mean that B's behaviour wasn’t successfully controlled. 

This generalises: **Looking forward in time, power is always a successful threat** of sorts.


PS: I don't have any martial arts skills.
