title: A practical theory of power in international politics
---
## Executive Summary

This essay proposes a practical theory of power for the study of international politics. The basic points are:
- The form politics takes is primarily determined by the **tension levels** between the States involved - friends cooperate, rivals compete, and enemies fight.[^wendtnote] 
- Tension levels **determine the means of power/threat States use** - e.g. friends don't use military threats, and enemies (combatants) are past trade disputes.
- The **escalation** of tension levels happens in **predictable, concrete steps** and is fairly well understood. I use the nine-step-model of conflict escalation model by Friedrich Glasl.
- **Institutions and treaties are designed to withstand a certain maximum level of tension.** If tensions escalate beyond their dispute settlement mechanisms, these structures falter or break down.
- Unsuccessful uses of power/threats is the **primary way conflicts escalate**.

[^wendtnote]: Academics might recognize Alexander Wendt's cultures of anarchy. Wendt, Alexander. _Social Theory of International Politics_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.

I believe the theory laid out here is superior to current theories in several respects: 
- It is empirically falsifiable and the most accurate.
- It is useful to practitioners who need a strong framework of analysis.
- It leads researchers to ask better research questions.
## What is politics?
As a starting point, it's difficult to disagree with Andrew Heywood’s introductory definition that politics is "the activity through which people make, preserve and amend **the general rules under which they live**."[^heywood]
[^heywood]: Heywood, Andrew. _Politics_. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007. 4.

Heywood’s introduction goes on to differentiate four categories of definitions: Politics understood as **(1) the art of government** (think Bismarck, Machiavelli, Easton, and arguably Clausewitz) and politics as **(2) public affairs** (Aristotle, Mill, Rousseau, Arendt, the liberal tradition more generally); politics as **(3) compromise** and consensus (Habermas, Crick), and politics as **(4) power and the distribution of resources** (Leftwich, Lasswell, realism, often feminism and Marxism).
### Politics without the State?
The first two differ mainly on whether or not politics happens when the State isn't involved. To define politics as the art of government is an **institutional definition**. It’s similar to Clausewitz’ definition of warfare as ‘everything that is related to the armed forces; their creation, maintenance and use.’[^clausewitz] So, labour relations, gender identity, religious obligations, or beauty standards; are these issues ‘political’ even when they don’t involve the State?

[^clausewitz]: Clausewitz, Carl Philipp Gottlieb von. _Vom Kriege_. Edited by J. Schulze. 1 edition. Null Papier Gratis, 1832. chap. 2.

I don't think this question should be predefined in general terms for all societies throughout history. Instead, let's extrapolate from Heywood’s initial definition: Whether or not politics is that which pertains to the State depends on whether in the given issue, place and time, the State is the institution which sets the ‘general rules’. If there is another institution setting the ‘general rules’ (e.g. the workplace, religious institutions, tribal clan structures, the EU, et cetera), then the process by which those 'general rules' are made, enforced or changed is inevitably political, and our theory should yield insights for it, too.
### Politics without power?
Heywood's latter two groups disagree mostly about whether politics also happens when nobody imposes their will on somebody else. When everybody agrees on a reasonable general rule, is that still politics?

As we shall see, it is largely correct that using power is anathema to friendship. It’s also correct that power is usually a key ingredient in politics (that is, in how the "general rules" are made). But to then say politics is _defined_ as that which involves power is effectively to assume that making rules cooperatively – as happens in most households around the globe on a daily basis – is humanely impossible, or too boring to think about. As Sir Bernard Crick put it: ‘Why call … a struggle for power ‘politics’ when it is simply a struggle for power?’[^crick]

## What is power?
Power is commonly defined as control: A has power over B if A can make B do what A wants. [^dahl] Hans J. Morgenthau elaborated: "Power may comprise anything that establishes and maintains the power of man over man. Thus power covers all social relationships which serve that end, from physical violence to the most subtle psychological ties by which one mind controls another."[^morgenthau]

[^dahl]: Dahl is (unjustly) often credited with the original complete formulation, Dahl, Robert A. ‘The Concept of Power’. _Behavioral Science_ 2, no. 3 (1957): 201–15. [https://doi.org/10.1002/bs.3830020303](https://doi.org/10.1002/bs.3830020303). For alternatives and a comprehensive taxonomy of power definitions in IR, see Barnett, Michael, and Raymond Duvall. ‘Power in Global Governance’. In _Power in Global Governance_, edited by Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall, 98:1–32. Cambridge University Press, 2004. Influential studies of political power work with this definition are, e.g., Dahl, Robert A. _Who Governs?: Democracy And Power In An American City_. Yale University Press, 2005; Lindblom, Charles Edward. _Politics and Markets: The World’s Political Economic Systems_. Basic Books, 1977.

### Power looking backward and forward in time

An interesting property of this definition is that one can only say whether A has power over B after power has been successfully used. The definition does not actually define any concrete thing that makes a State powerful vis-à-vis another State. It defines the effect you'll see when you **look back in time** - namely, that thing which will have made B do what A wants. The means that will achieve this control isn’t predefined – if anything, it’s post-defined. My martial arts skills do not give me in and of themselves power over you, only once I successfully used them to threaten you into giving me your ice cream can we potentially say that they give me power over you.

We’ll see that repeated and institutionalised interaction diminishes this problem. But here we’ll stick with simple power. In this realm, to know beforehand whether or not you’ll submit to the threat of my martial arts skills is somewhere between an art and a science. The reason is that it is _you_ who chooses to submit or not. In the moment right after I issued my threat, it’s **_your_ cost-benefit calculation that counts, not mine**. So it may be that you’re a judo master and confident that you could beat me easily. Even then, maybe to you the hassle just isn’t worth an ice cream. It requires some knowledge about the other party to know which threats they may yield to.

And if you choose not to submit and violence breaks out? Well, as Morgenthau (and many, many others) knew: "When violence becomes an actuality, it signifies the abdication of political power in favour of military or pseudo-military power."[^morgenthau] If you consider that A essentially tries to control B's behaviour, you immediately see that if A has to resort to brute physical force to do so (what Morgenthau called ‘military power’) that must mean that B's behaviour wasn’t successfully controlled.

This generalises: As we shall see, **looking forward in time, power is successful threat**. The really interesting thing a theory of power should do is to try and predict the means of threat/power that States will marshall...

PS: I don't have any martial arts skills.
## Predicting the means of power/threat

This part can be thought of as an update to Morgenthau’s view of human nature (more about his view in the academic part at the end). It’s based on the insight that the tension level between parties foreshadows before-the-fact which means of threat they will use if they choose to use power against each other. Power is a successful threat **using means associated with a higher tension level** - often the next higher level.

That's why it's utterly unbecoming to a friendship to attempt to use power - because you essentially threaten your friends with conflict escalation. Likewise it's irrelevant if you threaten an enemy with an angry letter - because the relationship is long past that point. The means I can reasonably be expected to use to attempt to control you depend on whether you are my friend, my rival, or my enemy. For **any individual act**, we can ask: Given the current relationship and its tension level, is this act escalatory, de-escalatory, or confirming the status quo?

This same way we also determine **how extreme an act** is. If Macron were to buy Schultz an ice-cream as a friendly gesture, that’d be slightly awkward, but basically confirming that they are friends. Yet, if Putin bought him an ice-cream, he'd (quite rightly) have it tested. Little details that are irrelevant among relaxed friends can become very important status symbols between tense enemies – like when [Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak couldn’t decide who enters the door first at Camp David](https://youtu.be/dLlZzzaxFLY?si=vCd0Df-EY7chcAnP&t=42).

In conflict research and social psychology, a great deal of research has been conducted into the nature of conflict escalation and de-escalation - a field I propose political analysts should tap into. How tensions escalate and friends become enemies is actually quite well understood, predictable and known in considerable detail. I shall now give a fairly detailed overview.

### Conflict escalation basics

This account uses as a framework to present the evidence a popular model of conflict escalation from the German conflict research literature – Friedrich Glasl’s _Konfliktmanagement_. He proposes a detailed nine step model of conflict degeneration (or escalation) in which two or more parties’ relationships slowly disintegrate from a mild hardening of positions to a total war of mutual obliteration. Glasl shows how the parties’ mutual understanding of the situation (‘tacit agreements’[^tacitagreements]) change in predictable ways between the nine stages. On each step of the ladder, the parties know which kind of behaviour is adequate and what constitutes a taboo. But because conflicts are very frustrating situations for us humans to be in, there is a tendency in each party on each step to try to dissolve the distressing ambiguity of the situation. And, one way we ironically choose is breaking the next taboo-barrier.

[^tacitagreements]: The term is from Schelling 1957. A good example is the following: “You are to meet somebody in New York City. You have not been instructed where to meet; you have no prior understanding with the person on where to meet; and you cannot communicate with each other. You are simply told that you will have to guess where to meet and that he is being told the same thing and that you will just have to try to make your guesses coincide.” (ibid., p. 21.) The majority of people would, without further instructions, pick the Grand Central Station, at ‘the meeting point,’ at noon. The idea is similar to Alexander Wendt’s ‘intersubjective understandings and expectations’. 

> "Crossing points of no return \[taboo-barriers\] thus means that one has reached a more intense stage of conflict. This new stage has its own norms, regiment and rules. But it is again clearly delineated by a new barrier. And precisely this barrier gives the parties – in spite of a heightened use of violence – new securities! Violence does not become limitless in a bang, but is again constrained. … The expectations remain – like Tomas Schelling says – co-ordinated."[^glasltaboo]

[^glasltaboo]: Glasl 2010, 230.

It is because these taboo-barriers act as discernible markers that conflict escalation models can have distinct stages. Glasl’s conflict escalation model can be imagined as a staircase with identifiable steps descending into the irrational regresses of our primordial past. On each such step, the parties share tacit agreements about what is permissible to do and about what is the next taboo-barrier.

With these distinct steps we can then deduce what means of power can be expected to be marshalled on each step. Indeed, as we shall see, this perspective utterly reframes the very nature of power as such.


# Academic discussion

> "\[T\]he more something looks like contemporary political science (that is, written by the few for the fewer, and favoring numbers and methods over facts and narrative) the less useful it tends to be." – Thomas E. Ricks[^ricks]

[^ricks]: Ricks, Thomas E. ‘Put down That Broad Brush, Steve!: I Remain Unpersuaded by Saideman’s Valiant Defense of Political Science’. _Foreign Policy Blogs_ (blog), 24 September 2014. [https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/24/put-down-that-broad-brush-steve-i-remain-unpersuaded-by-saidemans-valiant-defense-of-political-science/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/09/24/put-down-that-broad-brush-steve-i-remain-unpersuaded-by-saidemans-valiant-defense-of-political-science/).

Ricks is not the only one who thinks this way. A 2014 survey of 234 former US national security officials supports his claim. It found that "policymakers often find contemporary scholarship \[in political science\] less than helpful when it employs \[cutting edge research techniques\] across the board, for their own sake, and without a clear sense of how such scholarship will contribute to policymaking."[^avey]

On this website, then, I write against the same background of "impatience with the disciplinary boundaries of the social sciences in modern academia" against which Geoffrey Ingham wrote his seminal study of _The Nature of Money_. We both believe that the "specialization and fragmentation into 'sub-fields' and esoteric niches' has led to 'a loss of understanding of how the world works.'"[^ingham]
