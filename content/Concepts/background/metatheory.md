title: A practical theory of power in international politics

> "\[T\]he more something looks like contemporary political science (that is, written by the few for the fewer, and favoring numbers and methods over facts and narrative) the less useful it tends to be." – Thomas E. Ricks[^ricks]

Ricks is not the only one who thinks this way. A 2014 survey of 234 former US national security officials supports his claim. It found that "policymakers often find contemporary scholarship \[in political science\] less than helpful when it employs \[cutting edge research techniques\] across the board, for their own sake, and without a clear sense of how such scholarship will contribute to policymaking."[^avey]

On this website, then, I often write against the same background of "impatience with the disciplinary boundaries of the social sciences in modern academia" against which Geoffrey Ingham wrote his seminal study of _The Nature of Money_. We both believe that the "specialization and fragmentation into 'sub-fields' and esoteric niches' has led to 'a loss of understanding of how the world works.'"[^ingham]

Nevertheless, sooner or later every political analyst will have to confront the fundamental question of **what politics and power are**. The aim here is not to slide into an academic discussion, but to provide **accurate and useful concepts** for future analyses on LUZ.

Let's be clear from the outset that we are looking for **a descriptive definition, not a normative one**. We're not interested in what politics should be. We are interested in what politics is. 
## What is politics?

As a starting point, it's difficult to disagree with Andrew Heywood’s introductory definition that politics is "the activity through which people make, preserve and amend **the general rules under which they live**."[^heywood]

Heywood’s introduction goes on to differentiate four categories of definitions: Politics understood as the **art of government** (think of Bismarck, Machiavelli, Easton, and arguably Clausewitz) and politics as **public affairs** (Aristotle, Mill, Rousseau, Arendt, arguably the liberal tradition); politics as **compromise** and consensus (Habermas, Crick), and politics as **power** and the distribution of resources (Leftwich, Lasswell, realism, often feminism and Marxism).
### Politics without the State?
The first two differ mainly on whether or not politics happens when the State isn't involved. To define politics as the art of government is an **institutional definition**. It’s similar to Clausewitz’ definition of warfare as ‘everything that is related to the armed forces; their creation, maintenance and use.’[^clausewitz] So, labour relations, gender identity, religious obligations, or beauty standards; are these issues ‘political’ even when they don’t involve the State?

I see little reason to believe that this question can be answered in general terms for all societies throughout history. Instead, I suggest we extrapolate from Heywood’s initial definition: Whether or not politics is that which pertains to the State depends on whether the State is that which sets the ‘general rules’ for the given issue, place and time. If there is another institution which can ‘make, preserve and amend’ some or all of the ‘general rules’ (e.g. rules at the workplace, by the Vatican, tribal clan structures, the EU, et cetera), then the process by which those rules are made, enforced or changed is inevitably political, and power becomes a factor.
### Politics without power?
Heywood's latter two groups disagree mostly about whether politics also happens when nobody imposes their will on somebody else. When everybody agrees on a reasonable general rule, is that still politics?


## What is power?

In political science, power is most often defined as **power over somebody**: 
> A has power over B, if A can make B do what A wants.
