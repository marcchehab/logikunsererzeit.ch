Watching Tim Walz' interview of Fox News made me wonder: What abortion policy do the different States have and who are they governed by? Here's the breakdown. You can inspect the data and download the file [here]([abortion.xlsx](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AlKTrtwQHqH_kaFgTcAciNhRz3laVg?e=Q5dlO6)).

## How can you do that? 
1) I found the data on [kkf.org](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/state-indicator/gestational-limit-abortions/?activeTab=map&currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=statutory-limit-on-abortions&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D), which you can download as CSV to import into Excel. 
2) I then asked ChatGPT to add to this table the names and political parties of the governor. You should always factcheck output by AI, but this worked surprisingly well!
3) I then added this so Excel.
