In the US presidential elections 2024, there's a lot of talk about **"bringing those factories back"** after they've been "outsourced" to Mexiko or "offshored" to China. Watching this from Zurich, Switzerland, it's disheartening to see how there's next to no factual basis for the debate. 

So I made myself the **ultimate cheat-sheet** for this discussion, including:
- Jobs in US manufacturing ([US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001))
- Economic recessions ([Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/past-recessions.asp))
- Presidents
- Trade agreements that are often mentioned (NAFTA and granting China permanent normal trade relations)

## Phases of economic development

One of the oldest and best economic development models is the **three-sector model** by the Frenchman Jean Fourastié. It's good because it explains a lot with very little.

We first divide the economy into three sectors: **agriculture, industry and services**. Fourastié then observed that employment typically followed the same pattern before and after industrialisation.

Here are two historical charts of countries that show this empirically for the **United States** and for **Switzerland**:

Why do these phases occur?
### Pre-industrial phase
In pre-industrial societies, the vast majority (roughly 80-90%) worked in agriculture. Think about this in terms of productivity: To feed 100 people, at least 80 people had to toil on the fields.
### Industrial phase
As industrialisation took off in the 19th century, crop yield vastly improved thanks to mechanisation, specialisation and fertilizers. Today, **we produce more food than ever**, but only 1-2 percent work in agriculture. To feed 100 people, only 1 or 2 people are required (mostly to steer machines).

Simultaneously, new factories attracted employment, predominantly in the cities. A sizable share of the population now worked in those factories, constituting the **working class** who sold their labour to the **capitalists** owning the factories. Workers organised and bargained for better working conditions, better pay, sick leave, vacation, etc. That's the origin of the classical left-wing movements. 
### Post-industrial phase
The root causes that reduce the demand for industrial labour are productivity gains achieved by **rationalisation and automation**. Just like with agriculture, fewer and fewer workers are required to produce more and more output. These forces continuously shift **employment away from the industrial sector**. 

In the second half of the 20th century, the West thus entered the **post-industrial phase**. This isn't happening in one country because of some policy, it's happening across Western countries. [In this Excel-Sheet](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AlKTrtwQHqH_kaFk7PY0toqaK-OvVA?e=Orztqj) I visualized data [from the OECD](https://data-explorer.oecd.org/vis?df[ds]=dsDisseminateFinalDMZ&df[id]=DSD_LFS%40DF_IALFS_EMP_ISIC4_Q&df[ag]=OECD.SDD.TPS&df[vs]=1.0&pd=%2C&dq=CAN%2BGBR%2BSWE%2BUSA%2BCHE%2BFRA%2BDEU.EMP.._Z.Y._T.._X%2BBTF%2BGTU%2BA.A&to[TIME_PERIOD]=false&vw=tb&lb=bt). Notice the decline of industrial employment in all of them, like in the United States and Switzerland above.
