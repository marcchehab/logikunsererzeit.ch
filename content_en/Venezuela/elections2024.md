title: A ballot for Venezuela's unfree and unfair elections
---
No one with half a brain considers Venezuela's presidential elections in June 2024 to be either free or fair. The democratic opposition will nevertheless be standing against the authoritarian regime of [[Nicolás Maduro]], who will throw all of the petro-state's resources behind staying in power. The opposition has learnt the hard way (twice, actually) that a boycott is useless.

The logic of these elections is based on the political strategy of the authoritarian ruler: *divide et impera*, **divide and rule**. You can see this clearly on the official ballot paper if you know the stories behind the pictures.

## The logic of unfree elections

I will briefly explain these stories below. But this summary of the government's strategy may serve as a guiding principle so as not to get lost in the details.

> The dictatorship makes it nearly impossible for the real opposition to run for office, while it encourages corrupt and wild candidates to run independently. The logic is obvious: It is trying to fragment the opposition vote.

*Note that rows are the first digit is the row, the letter and the second digit the column.*

### 1: Thirteen places for Maduro
The first row is full of parties - big and small - that support [[Nicolás Maduro]] as a candidate.

### 2. Not even one for the real opposition
E25: The **coalition of democratic opposition parties is the MUD** (Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, now also called the "platform"). In primaries they selected [[María Corina Machado]] as their candidate, who received over 90% of the vote. However, the regime banned her from holding public office for 15 years during the primary election campaign and now banned her from registering for the presidential election, too. Machado picked a replacement candidate (Corina Yoris), who was also unable to register. After several attempts, the MUD was only able to put a little known politician on the ballot paper: the diplomat [[Edmundo González]]. He is now the opposition's unity candidate, representing the entire opposition.
Look at the entire ballot and that one square on E25: That's the actual opposition that, according to current polling ([April, Megaanálisis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tSReQeVZHrfA8aaYCP77026nz2x2WoDi/view?pli=1)), would easily defeat the government in a free and fair contest. Maduro is obliterated by all three candidates the real opposition put forward: If Machado were in the race, she'd flatten Maduro ~70% to ~9%, her barred replacement Yoris ~38% to ~10%.

Even the previously unknown González leads Maduro with ~32% to ~11%.

Though the "don't knows" (no sabe) are still substantial, it's obvious that, if you're Maduro, you cannot under any circumstances allow free and fair elections. So what do you do? Let's return to the ballot.

### 3: Opposition parties taken over by the regime
One option: The most important opposition parties were "intervened". This means that the Venezuelan Supreme Court (controlled by the dictatorship) arbitrarily removed the **party leaders** and replaced them with Maduro-friendly leaders who are now pretending to represent these parties.
- Vente Venezuela, Primero Justicia, Voluntad Popular, Acción Democrática, and COPEI are the main opposition parties in Venezuela. The actual leaders of these parties all support the MUD and the unity candidate. So the candidates marked "3" are not real candidates by these parties, but candidates by the artificially "intervened" juntas. The names of these **false candidates** are:
	- Daniel Ceballos for "Voluntad Popular"
	- Luis Eduardo Martínez for "Acción Democrática"
	- José Brito for "Primero Venezuela" (copycat of the real party called Primero Justicia)
	- Juan Carlos Alvarado for "COPEI" (candidature withdrawn for Luis Eduardo Martínez)
- The communists of PCV were also "intervened" in. They wanted to register their own candidate and not support Maduro.
- Incidentally: Vente Venezuela by [[María Corina Machado]] has been **denied registration as a political party** since 2015.

### 4: Wild candidates are given easy access

Another option: While the dictatorship made it almost impossible for the MUD to register, a plethora of smaller wild candidates were given easy access. I'll try and order them by how likely they are to withdraw and support the MUD.
- Un Nuevo Tiempo (G37) have registered their president **Manuel Rosales**, who was supported by MPV (G27) and Fuerza Vecinal (G47). He has since withdrawn and is in favour of electing the MUD unity candidate González.
- Enrique Márquez for Centrados (E35) is a genuine opposition figure and wants to "overcome" the conflict. He did not support the MUD's election boycott in 2018, which proved to be a mistake, and was kicked out of Nuevo Tiempo for it. Now he thinks Machado's disqualification was unfair - but now the field is open again. [Nevertheless, he says](https://www.youtube.com/live/u6mOGcM0AfA?si=5XcyVOUsTsqNSF9R&t=1902) who would withdraw if there was another candidate with a better chance of defeating Maduro. Let's see if he honours the pledge.
- Claudio Fermín for Soluciones (H48) also wants to ["end the polarisation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xniJAi4swMY). He has been in politics for a long time. 
- Antonio Ecarri from Lápiz portrays himself as the great conciliator and seeks equidistance from the government ("the worst government in the history of Venezuela") and the opposition ("just as much a disaster"). The opposition calls him corrupt and makes a big deal out of the fact that Maduro invited him to the Miraflores presidential palace. Note also the "Min Unidad" party, which looks very similar to the opposition's logo.
- Benjamín Rausseo is standing with Conde. He is a comedian and initially took part in the MUD primaries, but then withdrew. He may make 50-100 thousand votes.
- el cambio. javier bertucci. evangelist. actively supported by government. 
- Luis Rati entered the race for DD. He has withdrawn his candidacy and is supporting the false "Acción Democrática" candidate, Luis Eduardo Martínez.

It's perhaps unsurprising that all these third way candidates talk the third way talk of ending the polarization, overcoming the conflict, etc. Only that in the Venezuelan context, that's about as credible as those Europeans cozing up to Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine. It's an expression of the understandable but fundamentally juvenile wish to evade an inescapable confrontation.
