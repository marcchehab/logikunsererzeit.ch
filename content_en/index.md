title: Welcome to Logic of our Time!
---
This is a **knowledge garden** I'm only just starting to create. I'm Marc Ch√©hab from Switzerland and here I write about current affairs in international and Swiss politics. 

I used to be a news journalist, but I've grown quite sceptical of the news format. The approach of a knowledge garden is quite different: The idea is that the garden grows and adapts to the world. I'll focus on explaining the logic of current developments and how things work.

Much of the website is still not finished - obviously. But you can already read the first post about Venezuela.
